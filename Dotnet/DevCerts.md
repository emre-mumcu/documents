# dotnet dev-certs

dotnet dev-certs - Generates a self-signed certificate to enable HTTPS use in development.

The dotnet dev-certs command manages a self-signed certificate to enable HTTPS use in local web app development. Its main functions are:

* Generating a certificate for use with HTTPS endpoints during development.
* Trusting the generated certificate on the local machine.
* Removing the generated certificate from the local machine.
* Exporting a certificate in various formats so that it can be used by other tools.
* Importing an existing certificate generated by the tool into the local machine.

## Examples

```zsh
# Check for the presence of a development certificate, and create one in the default certificate store if one doesn't exist yet. But don't trust the certificate.
% dotnet dev-certs https

# Remove any development certificates that already exist on the local machine.
% dotnet dev-certs https --clean

# Create and trust a development certificate
% dotnet dev-certs https --trust

# Import a PFX file
% dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import ./certificate.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$

# Check if a trusted development certificate is present on the local machine.
% dotnet dev-certs https --check --trust

# Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PFX file.
% dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust

# Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PEM file.
% dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.crt --trust --format PEM

# Create a certificate, trust it, and export it to a PEM file including the private key:
% dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./certificate.crt -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust --format PEM
```
